# ATM Consultansy App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to create a basic navigation menu;
* Learn how to import widgets from different files;
* Learn how to navigate between screens;

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the App Works

When you inicialize the app, you will see four menu buttons, just click in one of them to navigate throught the app. Each page is different, so you can see that different widgets were imported for each menu button.
